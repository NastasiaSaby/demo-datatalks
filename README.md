# demo-datatalks

This project consists of notebooks (HTML or Python versions) that you can use to see examples of:
- Unit tests for data with GreatExpectations
- Model versioning with MLFlow
- Data versioning with DeltaLake

You can import the notebooks to use them on the Databricks platform: https://community.cloud.databricks.com
You can also just display the notebooks through Github if you just want to look at the results. To do that go into the folder *ipython-notebooks*
